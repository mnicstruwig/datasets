# Datasets
This repository contains various open datasets that I've found across the internet.

Most of these datasets come from open data portals and tend to be exported with
rather ugly schemas or formats. This repository serves as my own portal for
cleaned-up version of the various datasets I've worked with, often times
including additional features that make exploration of the data more convenient.

Since understanding how features are derived is an important property of
datasets, I've included all code that has been used to generate the improved
dataset (usually along with an example or two) directly next to the dataset
itself.
